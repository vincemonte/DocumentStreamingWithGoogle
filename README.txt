For the past CyberForce Competition held by the Department of Energy,
one of my tasks was to share information on each event that occurred. Having
communicated with the rest of my team before we participated on what this
entailed, I was told it required sustained communication with all team
members in order to capture each event accurately. The more I thought about the
situation, the more I realized that each team member could be given a Google
Form to log the event quickly and more accurately since they were responsible
at that given moment. Each entry of the form would be entered into my
Google spreadsheet and my python script utilizes the Google Drive and
Spreadsheet APIs to harvest data from the spreadsheet which I could use in
my Python script. Once I had all the data in the desired format, the rest of
the work involved implementing the python-docx library as to further streamline
all possible documentation needs. I've included some example .docx files as
well as the .txt file including all responses to showcase how easy it is to
pass data into different file formats. Needless to say, this contribution to
the competition allowed us to focus on the more tasking demands while
accurately depicting our work-flow.

For security purposes, the Google Form nor Spreadsheet have been included.
However, a great tutorial to get started with using the mentioned APIs can
be found on Tech With Tim's Youtube channel:
